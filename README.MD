# Responsive Portfolio
(https://bcefarmer.github.io/responsivePortfolio/)

## Purpose: 
This document is a responsive portfolio for Web Development Bootcamp student Bruce Farmer.  It uses the CSS framework "Bootstrap" to style the document.

## Languages Used:
This app uses HTML5 and the CSS Bootstrap framework.

## Style:  
There are three pages in this web application: index.html (an "About" page), contact.html (a basic contact form) and a portfolio titled "portfolio.html." At the top of each page is a navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller devices and browser resizes.
