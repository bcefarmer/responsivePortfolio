# Responsive Portfolio
(https://bcefarmer.github.io/responsivePortfolio/)

## Purpose: 
This document is a revised responsive portfolio for Web Development Bootcamp student Bruce Farmer.  

Here are alterations from the original:

1) The nav part of this document is now created dynamically via jQuery, and the text color altered depending on the background image.

2) Media query included to shift portfolio to scrollable overflow box when on a large screen.

3) New backgrounds.

## Languages Used:
This app uses HTML5, jQuery and the CSS Bootstrap framework.

## Style:  
There are three pages in this web application: index.html (an "About" page), contact.html (a basic contact form) and a portfolio titled "portfolio.html." At the top of each page is a navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller devices and browser resizes.
